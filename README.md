# BrickBraker
This is a simple implementation of the game Brick Braker In C++ written in Xcode as a SDL graphics program for Mac. It should be a simple port to other platforms simply open the CPP files and the HPP files in another IDE. Note as long as you have implemented the SDL2 standard Library you are good to go. 

## Implementations that I want to add
For now the game is all there is, I want some day to implement a menu, score counter and a winning screen, but for now alle of this is happening in the GameManger file. 

However, the seeds for an expansion has been put down. The event manager handles all the events necessary for the program as of now. In an expanded edition it could also control other stuff like muse events and arrow up and down and enter events. Alle of these would be useful in a menu since that would require navigation.
